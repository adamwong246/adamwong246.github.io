## adamwong246.github.io

This is an exceedingly simple blog made with Grunt and deployed to Github pages here: http://adamwong246.github.io/

You might be interested in forking this project if...
* you want a blog, fast and easy
* you know js and grunt
* you don't need a database, just static files
* you think that jekyll is a bit too restrictive
* you want to learn a flexible workflow for any job, not just a personal blog.
