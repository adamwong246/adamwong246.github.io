It is a trivial example, but [this commit](https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io/commit/2bbfc221981fc7340495c62a6199038b4abe76c7#diff-6657a3e3631775b73cfcf76322c98598afa6d28b8e3ab2d4f5d55b5bf7b75855) shows just how easy that is to do with webcrack. You can see the sitemap in action by clicking the link at the bottom of each page.
