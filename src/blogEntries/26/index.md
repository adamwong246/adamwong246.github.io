title: Smarter "Read more" links

I've re-worked the link shown on blog "previews." The index page shows the latest 5 posts with truncated previews. This mechanism is much much better now- it shows just the first element of the post, rather than truncating it. If the content is longer than 1 element, it shows the "Read more" link.

For example, this paragraph is not visible from the index page, but it is visible on the blog page.
