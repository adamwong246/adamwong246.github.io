<p>What if I told you I was making a social network from scratch? Something that could rival both Facebook and Twitter, stealing the best bits from both, and discarding the rest, to create the most humane and benevolent platform possible? And what if we assumed, for the moment, a simple proposition- users would pay directly for such a product. What if indeed. It sound ludicrous at face value. A realistic challenger of the twin titans is nearly unthinkable. And asking users to simply pay for the service? Outrageous!</p>
<p>I love AI driven development. It lets me code at the speed of thought. As a coder, you can often see software in your mind, but which you do not have the time and energy that it would take to implement. The statue already exists inside the marble and you just need to remove the right pieces, except, for a long time, all you had was a hammer and chisel. With AI, you have a jackhammer, the ability to blast away huge swaths of stone and reveal the statue that lies within. Features that would take months now take days. And it is this power which has allowed me to, in the span of less than a week, create an entire AWS stack and basic social network from scratch. It has all the trimmings- a serverless architecture, tests, a developer CLI tool, cognito integration, a react frontend and a bulletproof cloudformation template. I cannot impress upon you how much effort it would take to implement this a few years ago, and how little effort is needed today. Digging through AWS is used to be a slow and miserable experience, but DeepSeek took care of the details, lickity-split. AIDD is probably more than 10X productivity buff. I have written remarkably little code, instead pair-programming with aider. Certainly my years of experience helped, and while sometimes the AI made foolish decisions, often it can provide profound insights. I spend a little bit of time following it's reasoning, and usually the machine is 100% correct. I spend a lot of time loading files into and out of it's context, copying error messages from one terminal to another running Aider, and then copying Aiders advice back into the first. Sometimes I dual wield 2 AI at once, yet my my api bill is about 10 bucks a month. It's astonishing.</p>
<p>This network is called Indra, btw. As in, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net">Indra's Net</a></p>
<p>So yeah, that's the plan. I'm gonna make a better social network, and charge people 5 bucks a month to use it, directly challenging 2 of the richest men on earth. Wish me luck!</p></body></html></article><hr><div class="back-and-forward-links"><div class="back-link"> <a href="/blog/63-/index.html">⬅️ </a></div><div class="forward-link"><a href="/blog/74-The-Third-Testament/index.html">The Third Testament ➡️</a></div></div></main></div><footer><span><a href="https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io">v2.3.0</a> <a href="/sitemap.html">sitemap </a> <img src="/favicon.png"></span></footer></body></html>
