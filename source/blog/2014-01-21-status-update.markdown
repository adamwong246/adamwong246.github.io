I'm very happy with the progress I've made on my blog. There's a new responsive layout with a google web font- just enough flair to make your web page pop without too much weight.  Not that I couldn't have used a CSS framework. I have in the past used Bootstrap and to excellent effect. But this go round, I've decided lightweight is best. So that means no css frameworks, no js and no database- all plain old html... for now.
