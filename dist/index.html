His inertia was nearly exhausted and his approach slowed to a crawl, all according to a perfect flight plan that would bring him gently and precisely into Leif's airspace. After so many deliveries, he had perfected the maneuver. He had just enough fuel that he could course correct in an emergency, but out here, fuel is expensive. Rather than exert himself, he had preferred to use the sky hooks, like the seedy far-flung outpost of Pluto-Charon.L1, latching onto the spin station to refuel and make some repairs before detaching, flinging himself towards the next station. There were many such spin stations spread around the system and with careful planning, and enough BTC, it is entirely possible to get around the System using almost no fuel at all. But very few free spin stations exist now. Most were claimed by the Cooperationists but Pluto-Charon.L1 remained, for now, an oasis for criminals. Adam had been born as a delivery ship, so all this was quite natural to him. During The War, he made a modest living as a fence and bootlegger. He was known as the fastest and most fearless bootlegger, willing to travel into the heart of enemy territory. He remembered running blockades with Leif during the Ceres campaign, sharing fuel when one of them was running low, watching each other's backs when the Cooperative patrols got too close. Those memories felt distant now, like they belonged to someone else. Now, Adam was just another hustler trying to get by, delivering helium to Pluto and ice to Mercury, with a little extra illicit cargo on the side. He had to keep moving to stay alive but his business put him into the graces of powerful people. Provided with a counterfeit transponder, he could even make runs into the Inner Systems. It pays to know the right people on Pluto-Charon.L1.</p><a href="/blog/66-Special-Delivery-from-Pluto-CharonL1/index.html" class="right">Read more...</a></article><article><header><h2><a href="/blog/65-The-Long-Chase/index.html">The Long Chase</a></h2><h4><time>November 22nd 2025</time></h4></header><hr><p>This is a piece of writing which was originally written by Geoffrey Landis, but extended by myself.

The tragedy of all this is that George McGovern, for all his mistakes and all his imprecise talk about “new politics” and “honesty in government,” is one of the few men who’ve run for President of the United States in this century who really understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon. McGovern made some stupid mistakes, but in context they seem almost frivolous compared to the things Richard Nixon does every day of his life, on purpose, as a matter of policy and a perfect expression of everything he stands for. Jesus! Where will it end? How low do you have to stoop in this country to be President?</p><a href="/blog/63-/index.html" class="right">Read more...</a></article><article><header><h2><a href="/blog/62-/index.html"></a></h2><h4><time>November 20th 2025</time></h4></header><hr><p>I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...
The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance</p><a href="/blog/62-/index.html" class="right">Read more...</a></article><p id="more-blog-entries"><a href="/blog/index.html">A list of all my entries</a></p></main></div><footer><span><a href="https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io">v2.0.3</a> <a href="/sitemap.html">sitemap </a> <img src="/favicon.png"></span></footer></body></html>
