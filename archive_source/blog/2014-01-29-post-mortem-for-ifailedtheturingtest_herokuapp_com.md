### Here lies another halfbaked idea

I'm completely abandoning my old blog. It was a good try but perhaps too ambitious. Sadly, it's not well tested and a lot of stuff is totally half-baked, thought there were a lot of really good ideas.

* Bootstrap
* Sass
* RailsAdmin
* Nested, reddit-style comments
* tumblr integeration

### What did I learn?

Don't aim too *far.* By all means, aim high but don't try to accomplish everything because, frankly, it's a hell of a lot of work and this wheel has been invented before. In truth, it failed because *I never wrote any content.* I just hacked on the app itself. 

This time around, I'm going the the much simpler, but satisfyingly hackable, Middleman. Static files are an order of magnitude easier to develop and deploy.
