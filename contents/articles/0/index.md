I'm pleased to debut my *new* blog, which is made with Grunt and Wintersmith, as opposed to Middleman. I've decided for a while now that I want to move away from Ruby and do more Javascript. So lets talk about how I made the migration. 


I think it's helpful, firstly, to understand the analogy between my old site and the new. 

| Software              | Old       | New         |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Language              | Ruby      | JS          |
| Package manager       | Bundle    | Npm         |
| make tool             | Rake      | Grunt       |
| static site generator | Middleman | Wintersmith |
| template engine       | Slim      | Jade        |
