# README
## adamwong246.github.io

This is my personal website, made with my custom build-tool [funkophile](https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io/tree/dev/funkophile).

Because of the nature of github pages, development is done on the [dev branch](https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io/tree/dev).
