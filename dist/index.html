His inertia was nearly exhausted and his approach slowed to a crawl, all according to a perfect flight plan that would bring him gently and precisely into Leif's airspace. After so many deliveries, he had perfected the maneuver. He had just enough fuel that he could course correct in an emergency, but out here, fuel is expensive. Rather than exert himself, he had preferred to use the sky hooks, like the seedy far-flung outpost of Pluto-Charon.L1, latching onto the spin station to refuel and make some repairs before detaching, flinging himself towards the next station. There were many such spin stations spread around the system and with careful planning, and enough BTC, it is entirely possible to get around the System using almost no fuel at all. But very few free spin stations exist now. Most were claimed by the Cooperationists but Pluto-Charon.L1 remained, for now, an oasis for criminals, outcasts and refugees. </p><a href="/blog/66-Special-Delivery-from-Pluto-CharonL1/index.html" class="right">Read more...</a></article><article><header><h2><a href="/blog/67-Silass-Last-Score/index.html">Silas's Last Score</a></h2><h4><time>November 26th 2025</time></h4></header><hr><p>The Setup: Silas has been the Don's most reliable "problem solver" for centuries - handling everything from rival gang disputes to "convincing" reluctant business partners.
