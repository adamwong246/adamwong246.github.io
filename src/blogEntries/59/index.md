          🤖 Tests That Write Themselves? Meet Testeranto!
```

We're thrilled to announce Testeranto 0.143.0 - the most advanced
version yet of our groundbreaking AI-powered testing framework! If
you're tired of writing tedious tests or struggling to keep your test
suite up-to-date with your codebase, Testeranto is about to become your
new best friend.


## 🎯 What Makes Testeranto Special?

### 1️⃣ Self-Testing Architecture (Now Complete!)

  For the first time ever, Testeranto can test itself! That's right - our
  entire framework is now verified by its own testing infrastructure. This
  milestone proves that Testeranto's architecture is robust enough to
  handle even the most complex testing scenarios. If it's good enough to
  test itself, imagine what it can do for your projects!

### 2️⃣ Beautiful BDD Interface

Say goodbye to messy test files! Testeranto's Behavior-Driven
Development (BDD) interface gives you:

```
 Suite.Default("User Authentication", {
   loginTest: Given.WithCredentials(
     ["User should authenticate with valid credentials"],
     [When.submitLogin("user@example.com", "secure123")],
     [Then.verifyLoggedIn(), Then.verifySessionCreated()]
   )
 });
 ```

Clean, readable tests that document your system's behavior while
verifying its correctness.

### 3️⃣ AI-Optimized Bundling (Our Secret Sauce)

Here's where things get really exciting:

 1 esbuild-powered bundling creates ultra-efficient test packages
 2 Metafile generation gives you the exact list of files included
 3 Perfect LLM context - feed only the relevant files to your AI
   assistant

This means when tests fail, you can send the exact right context to your
AI coding assistant to get perfect fixes every time!


## 🔥 The Testeranto Value Proposition

Imagine this workflow:

 1 Write your feature in plain English (via BDD specs)
 2 Let Testeranto generate the initial test implementation
 3 When tests fail, send the perfectly-sized bundle to your AI assistant
 4 Get back working code that passes all tests

It's testing that practically writes itself!


## 🙏 Special Thanks to Aider

None of this would be possible without the incredible work behind Aider.
Aider's innovative approach to AI-assisted coding provided the
foundation that makes Testeranto's AI integration so powerful. Huge
kudos to the Aider team for pushing the boundaries of what's possible
with LLMs in software development!
