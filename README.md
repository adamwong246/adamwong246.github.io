## adamwong246.github.io

This is an exceedingly simple blog made with Middleman and deployed to Github pages.

Because of how github pages works, the 'master' branch is preserved for, and only for, the outputed website. If you are looking for work in progress, visit one of the branches, probably the 'middleman' branch. https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io/tree/middleman

* you know ruby, bundler and rake
* you don't need a database, just static files
* you think that jekyll is a bit too restrictive
* you want to write html, css and js with the templating language of your own choice
