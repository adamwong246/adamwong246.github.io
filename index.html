        <h2>First post</h2><p>This is my first blog post!!!</p>

        <h2>Soylent, day to day</h2><p>Ever since I backed Soylent on Kickstarter, I&#39;ve been a little obsessed with the stuff. Well, &quot;obsessed&quot; might not be the right word... &quot;consumed&quot; might be a better. &quot;Evangelical&quot; has been tossed around. Seriously, a day does not go by when I do not attempt to bring some poor soul into fold. If someone asks what biege slurry I&#39;m gulping down, I launch into a full scale attack to win the hearts and minds of &quot;fooders&quot; and turn them into &quot;Soylentarians.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="what-s-in-it-">What&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>Mostly sugar. Maltodextrin to be specific. Sugars are molecules in the form of a chain. Shorter chains are the sugar you are most familiar with. Table sugar, glucose, sucrose and fructose fall into this category. Long chains are your breads, pastas and rice- all starches, basicaly. </p>
<p>Next comes oats and brown rice flour. These provide your protein and fiber. Everything else is your vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>Lastly, don&#39;t forget the oils! </p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-it-">How do you get it?</h2>
<p>Order it only. You can get 1 weeks, 2 weeks or 4 weeks worth of Soylent at a time. If you buy the subscription, you get a discount. If it&#39;s your first order, it&#39;s going to take a long time. Go complain about it on the forums but it won&#39;t do any good. It took me a year and half to get mine! But after your first shipment, latter orders arrive much faster.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-make-it-">How do you make it?</h2>
<p>Each days Soylent is a bag of powder and a vial of oil. Put the powder in the pitcher and add water. Shake until it&#39;s wells mixed. Add the oil and shake again. Each pitcher is one day of food for one person. I divide it up into 2 meals and snack, in 3 of those shaker bottles. </p>
<h2 id="what-s-it-taste-like-">What&#39;s it taste like?</h2>
<p>I would not be ungracious if I said Soylent tastes a bit like Play Do. Not in a bad way though. It&#39;s slightly sweet but more than anything at all, it&#39;s bland. There&#39;s a distinct texture which has been described as &quot;silty.&quot; I don&#39;t find it unpleasant but others often do. I don&#39;t understand this at all- my best guess is that it&#39;s a subconcious bias.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-it-like-living-on-soylent-">What&#39;s it like living on Soylent?</h2>
<p>Well, first, I don&#39;t live on Soylent alone and I don&#39;t recommend anyone try. Living on Soylent alone would be a sad existence. It&#39;s also more dangerous than even I dare to tread. Though I consume more than 50% of my food as Soylent, I&#39;m still wary about the long term effects. But more than that, food is good. And after eating Soylent for breakfast and lunch, by dinner I want food. Sweet, salty, spicy food!</p>
<p>I can&#39;t stress this enough. After the blandness of Soylent, &quot;real&quot; food tastes extraordinary. You can&#39;t help but ruminate on your food. The tastes and textures are so much more pronounced, even boring foods like toast are exciting. Spicy chicken wings, Doritos, chocolate and Dr Pepper will blow your mind after a little Soylent.</p>
<p>Another big change is that you have more of your most important resources- time and money. If you were like me, you were spending up to $20 a day on food and over an hour of time shopping, cooking, eating and then cleaning up after. On Soylent, you can make all 3 meals in 60 seconds, for less than 10 bucks. There are days when loading the dishasher makes no sense, cause the only dirty dishes are the pitcher and shaker bottles. You eating utensils will reamin unused. </p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-downsides-">What are the downsides?</h2>
<p>The worst problem is well documented- Solent Farts. It&#39;s advised that you gradually increase your Soylent intake. This gives your gut a chance to adjust. Otherwise you can expect some really explosive gas. It&#39;s not just copious amounts of stinky farts, gas can get so bad it actually hurts. GasX and Beano both help. Thankfully, these symptoms subside eventually. </p>
<p>Another problem is one of will power. Like I said, Soylent makes you appreciate the sensation of eating real food. Soylent nourishes the body but not the soul. If your not careful, you will find yourself walking out of the grocery store with a pint of ice cream, spicy doritos and soda cause it tastes that darn good. And you&#39;ll find it easier to rationalize to yourself, because you ate 2 solid healthy meals</p>
