I connected my Android Pixel to my computer and with a little hackery was able to pry the YouTube app off my phone. It comes "preinstalled" on the Pixel, which apparently also means it's "not easily uninstallable". You have to launch the phone in dev mode and use ADB to truly exorcise the demon, but I was not going to let that stop me. And with that, my phone is now without any distractions. Nothing. No Facebook, no Twitter (and no, I will NOT call it X!), no news of any kind. Not even Reddit, one of my oldest and dearest online spaces, escaped my scythe. Not just uninstalled, the accounts have been deleted, and years of careful curation Thanos-snapped away. When I go to the bathroom, I don't even bother to bring my phone anymore. My Pixel is now more like an old Nokia dumb phone, except that you can use it to pay for bus fare.</p>
<p>I have been on a bit of a quest, you see. After losing my awesome job, most of my life savings, my democracy and my sanity, well, I needed to digitally detox. So, I logged off. In the meantime, I have been living my house-husband trad-wife best life, drinking tea, re-modeling a kitchen, seeing my doctor, walking the dogs, writing the most inspired code of my life and trying, somehow, to get back on the horse. This algorithm-less life has for the most part been quite a success, except that we are going broke. So, yeah, time to dust off that LinkedIn profile and start knocking on doors. "Can you explain this gap in your resume?" they ask and I struggle for an answer. Was it a sabbatical, or a vacation, or a mid-life crisis, or an alcohol fueled major depressive episode? No answer seems appropriate, so I just reply that "I felt like it" and pray that the candor is well received. It usually isn't.</p>
<p>Back in my day, the internet came in the mail and movies came from a red vending machine at the grocery store. We had AOL on the family Bondi Blue iMac, putting 10-year-old Adam on the cutting edge, relatively speaking. Once I got home from school, I was left unattended with an online connection, neither of my parents really understanding the ramifications of such. Newgrounds.com and Unreal Tournament were my original stomping grounds. Rotten.com was known as the worst the Web had to offer- now such degeneracy seems quaint. Those were the glory days of Flash and Shareware games, Hamster Dances and LolCats. We were told by our parents, "Don't believe everything you read on the Internet" and yet, the Internet was, at that time, far more trustworthy than it is today.</p>
<p>My oh my how things have changed. </p>
<p>Let me just say what we are all thinking- the Internet sucks now. The enshitification is complete. I'm not just a whiny old fogey. We really are going backwards, undermining the internet's original purpose and poisoning the very web itself. The free, mostly benevolent shared space is gone. What once was a broad open field is now a small number of vast cattle yards. That which refuses to be penned in is strip-mined by AI, stealing the very soul of billions of humans as blithely as a child might pick up a pretty seashell, but which was then traded for a mountain of gold. The richest, least trustworthy men on Earth rule their empires while openly colluding with The Evil One. At best they coddle his ego. At worst, they turn their kingdoms into scammy, sloppy propaganda mills. Yet even as Altman, Zuckerberg, Cook and Musk line up to curtsy and bow in Trump's court, we continue to stay logged in. We keep buying iPhones and Pixels, despite entirely adequate alternatives. We scroll down down down the infinite well of "content", knowing it makes us sick. We know it powers the fortunes of fascists. Why do we fall for the same trick? Is it base human desire to live so brainlessly, our evolutionary design driving us towards reward without regard to consequence? Or is it the voracious greed of smart, mean little nerds, for whom even the whole world is not enough?</p>
<p>A few months ago, I decided to return from my hermitage, descend from the mountain and try to live some better way. I had developed a pathological, techno-agoraphobic fear of my phone, emails and SMS, preferring to leave my phone off for days at a time. Now I felt brave enough to answer phone calls at least. I tentatively opened the apps- they were still there, but everything was so much worse. I tried to read the news at least but my heart could not bear to look upon the ruins- My mind refuses to grapple with the horror of politics. When my vote-by-mail ballot appears in my mailbox, I drop it directly into the recycling bin. It's honestly amazing that I paid my taxes.</p>
<p>Thus began a great culling. </p>
<p>The first to go were Facebook and Twitter. Facebook had all my friends and family, and Twitter mostly served as a means of accumulating free porn, but I could not in good conscience allow these accounts to live. Salting the earth behind me, I deleted the phone apps. Next up was Reddit, my first love. I considered how much value Reddit had actually provided me over the years. Not much time was needed before I kissed Reddit goodbye, looked into her eyes, slit her throat and buried the corpse in the garden. Adieu pour toujours, mon amour! Next came the news apps. Reddit had always been my chief source for news, but there was still the Google News app on my phone that could hold my attention for brief periods, but in the words of Marie Kondo, it did not bring me joy. Which brings me to YouTube, the sole survivor. I wanted to keep it, I really did. "I listen to music on YT" I thought. But in the end, it had to die along with the others. The phone app is deleted, but the account is retained for the desktop. It's allowed to live, only to endure daily whippings with the "Do not recommend" button. Don't cross me- your whole channel will be blacklisted for the utter impudence of annoying me with short form videos and god help you should your AI slop appear upon my feed. </p>
<p>The final fire bomb was the <code>etc/hosts</code> file. With it, I am entirely isolated from social media networks, save a few. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamwong246/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/hosts">Here is the result</a></p>
<p>It's certainly a different life now. I used to scroll through the night, only to start scrolling again the moment I was awake. Now when I get up in the morning, I drink coffee, stretch, take my crazy pills, eat some eggs and bacon, and take a bath, not a shower, but a real honest to goodness bubble bath. With the time saved, I can afford to shave my head every day. It's nice to feel so rushed. But it's almost rude at this point to reject the apps. Sort of like, "I don't own a TV" or "I don't eat meat", the proposition is almost always received as a humble brag. I wonder how one rebuilds a career in tech, while rejecting its foundations. I wonder what my family is posting on Facebook, and what porn is going unappreciated on Twitter. I hate myself for giving up politically, wondering if I am a bad person for burying my head in the sand. I fear for where all this is going, how bad it will get before we finally stand up and say "no more." I cry for the people less lucky than I, those who must grind at unglamorous low paid labor, only to return home exhausted, with no real friends and nothing to do but stare at a hyper bright magic rectangle, before repeating the same, day after day, till an AI finally takes their livelihood. That job will be automated away by programmers not so different than myself, each of us scrambling to stay ahead of bankruptcy, dragging each other down as we struggle to keep our own head above water, knowing that someday soon, your job too will go away, if not taken by AI, then by a Mexican teenager who is smarter than you but will work for less pay. What happens when the machines finally take everyone's job? How will we be able to buy, or sell, anything? Why should one produce products if no one can afford them?</p>
<p>There are dark times ahead. Humans are barreling down the wrong path, with the accelerator on the floor, heading for a cliff that will launch us like Thelma and Louise into techno-feudalism. Forget about, for just a moment, global warming. We now face an info-apocalypse, when nothing is real, and everything is a meme. I can still foresee a day when the misinformation bubble finally pops and the internet rapidly shrinks, and that's the good scenario. The worst scenario is a prison-planet, 1984 and Brave New World combined into whatever shape that the House of Trump might desire. With AI, they will manipulate you. With AR, they will be able to rewrite reality in front of your very eyes. No need to tear apart the human mind with your hands- give them some shiny toys and they will do it for you. And at long last, we arrive at the final goal- a jihad against general computing. One day, you will not just be obliged to carry an iPhone- one will be assigned to you at birth- and everything will be an app. Could they actually outlaw coding itself? Even if they cannot, surely they will try.</p>
<p>For me, this writing is a eulogy for the internet. The fun and trust is gone- what's left is an even more insidious version of cable TV and you can count me out. I still love coding and much of my time now is spent learning to use AI tools. But I don't live on the web is gone- I just work here now. </p></body></html></article><hr><div class="back-and-forward-links"><div class="back-link"> <a href="/blog/59-Testeranto-01430-testeranto-is-officially-self-testing/index.html">⬅️ Testeranto 0.143.0 - testeranto is officially self-testing</a></div><div class="forward-link"><a href="/blog/62-/index.html"> ➡️</a></div></div></main></div><footer><span><a href="https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io">v2.0.2</a> <a href="/sitemap.html">sitemap </a> <img src="/favicon.png"></span></footer></body></html>
