- I used [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for a base, [Holy Grail](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/holy-grail/) to implement a fluid layout and a sticky footer and for typography, [Typebase.css](http://devinhunt.github.io/typebase.css/). Of course, I've added my own [light touch](https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io/blob/master/_src/style.css) but so far, it's quite a neutral theme.
- Each blog is now routed to a nicer url and jpgs included in the same file get re-mapped to a absolute url, so managing images for specific blog entries is easy.
- I used the same technique that generates my resume to turn the `README.md` into an html file.

Of course, you can see for yourself by [tracking the commits on github](https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io/commits/master)! And if you wanted to see what's next on my todo list, check out the [issues](https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io/issues).

Finally, I bumped the version to `0.1.0`, which according to SemVer I should have done already.
