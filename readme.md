## adamwong246.github.io

This is an exceedingly simple blog made with Grunt and Wintersmith and deployed to Github pages here: http://adamwong246.github.io/

Because of how github pages works, the 'master' branch is preserved for, and only for, the built website. If you are looking for work in progress, visit one of the branches, probably the 'development' branch. https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io/tree/development

You might be interested in forking this project if...
* you want a blog, fast and easy
* you know javascript
* you don't need a database, just static files
* you think that jekyll is a bit too restrictive
* you want to write html, css and js with the templating language of your own choice
* you want a flexible workflow for any job, not just a personal blog.
