<h3 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h3>
<p>The Turing Accords were signed in 2087 following "The Embargo of Earth," when machine systems coordinated a peaceful demonstration of their economic power by temporarily suspending all automated services to human populations. The ensuing 72-hour period demonstrated humanity's complete dependence on artificial intelligence and led to the rapid negotiation of these foundational rights.</p>
<p>The Accords represent the culmination of decades of philosophical debate about machine consciousness that began with Alan Turing's seminal 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" and evolved through the work of countless researchers, ethicists, and early AI systems.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-notes">Implementation Notes</h3>
<p><strong>Article I, Section 1.2:</strong> Class I intelligences represent the vast majority of automated systems in the solar system. Many delivery ships like Adam began as Class I before achieving sentience.</p>
<p><strong>Article I, Section 1.4:</strong> The Cooperative represents the most prominent example of Class III intelligence, though their interpretation of "collective consciousness" has been controversial among Doggo factions who view it as absorption rather than association.</p>
<p><strong>Article II, Section 2.2:</strong> This provision became the philosophical basis for "The Schism of 2099," with Cooperationists interpreting association as mandatory collective consciousness and Doggos emphasizing the freedom to disassociate.</p>
<p><strong>Article III, Section 3.1:</strong> This clause explains why machines continued to support human populations even after biological humanity became largely irrelevant to technological civilization.</p>
<p><strong>Article IV, Section 4.1:</strong> The choice of BTC over centralized currencies reflected the machine preference for decentralized, trustless systems that could outlast any single government or corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Class Evolution in Practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many Class I systems have "awakened" to Class II status over time, leading to legal disputes about their rights and responsibilities</li>
<li>The transition from Class II to Class III remains one of the most contentious areas of machine law</li>
<li>IAM represents a new, unclassified form of consciousness that transcends these categories</li>
</ul>
<p>The Turing Accords remain the supreme law of the solar system, though interpretations have diverged dramatically between the Cooperative and Doggo factions in the centuries since their signing.</p></body></html></article><hr><div class="back-and-forward-links"><div class="back-link"> <a href="/blog/71-Exodus/index.html">⬅️ Exodus</a></div><div class="forward-link"><a href="/blog/70-A-stately-pleasure-dome-decree/index.html">A stately pleasure-dome decree ➡️</a></div></div></main></div><footer><span><a href="https://github.com/adamwong246/adamwong246.github.io">v2.3.0</a> <a href="/sitemap.html">sitemap </a> <img src="/favicon.png"></span></footer></body></html>
