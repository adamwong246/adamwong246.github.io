Just a short video showing a thing I made in factorio. This uses several mods.

- PowerOverload for exploding power poles
- Moon_Logic for a lua combinator
- electricTransformators for transformers

By dialing in a constant combinator 0 - 100%, I can power a wing of my factory, AND keep it under a safety threshold. At the end, I short circuit the whole apparatus to see some fireworks.
