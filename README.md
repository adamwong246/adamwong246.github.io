> "It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience." ~ Albert Einstein

An exceedingly simple blog written in coffeescript, run by cake, managed with npm and hosted on Github pages.

This is an attempt to build a blog from the ground up. It is built out of pure code- no grunt or gulp plugins here! It's not as fast or as featurefull as, say, Jekyll, but it's made from scratch to my exact specifications.

It is under constant development and you can follow on github. Even better, why don't you fork it for yourself?

### Rules
1. Thou shalt not use `<h1>` or `<h2>` in content. `<h1>` is reserved the title of the website and `<h2>` is reserved for the *page* title.
