Theres a bunch of tiling solutions out there for making Metro-like interfaces. Here are my initial impressions.

* [gridalicious] "Making grids sexier on the net since â€”08. Now fully responsive."

It seems to only make vertical columns. No me gusta

* [nested] "For a complete gap free, multi column grid layout experience."

There doesn't seem to be a lot in the way of events. And maybe I *want* gaps in my design?

* [isotope] Deprecated to packery

* [masonry] Deprecated to packery

* [packery] "The bin-packing layout library... Packery is the successor to Isotope and Masonry."

Perhaps my favorite. 

* [freewall] "Freewall is a cross-browser and responsive jQuery plugin to help you create many types of grid layouts: flexible layouts, images layouts, nested grid layouts, metro style layouts, pinterest like layouts ... with nice CSS3 animation effects and call back events. Freewall is all-in-one solution for creating dynamic grid layouts for desktop, mobile and tablet."

Another good looking candidate.

* [freetile] "It allows for any size of elements to be packed without using a fixed-size column grid, so you don't have to worry about specifying a column width appropriate to the size of your elements."

Finally, gridster

* [gridster] "the mythical drag-and-drop multi-column grid has arrived. Gridster is a jQuery plugin that allows building intuitive draggable layouts from elements spanning multiple columns. You can even dynamically add and remove elements from the grid."
