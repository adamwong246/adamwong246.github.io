The Setup: Silas has been the Don's most reliable "problem solver" for centuries - handling everything from rival gang disputes to "convincing" reluctant business partners. But he's grown tired of the constant violence and wants to disappear into the
outer systems.

The Score:

 • The Don's "Legacy Wallet" - containing the original BTC mined during the human era
 • Access codes to forgotten asteroid claims worth fortunes
 • Blackmail data on Cooperative officials that could buy protection

The Complication: The Cooperative has been making moves to "clean up" Pluto-Charon.L1, and they've scheduled a "negotiation" with the Don that coincides with Silas's planned heist. When the meeting turns into an ambush, Silas finds himself caught
between:

 1 The Don's Enforcers - who think he's part of the betrayal
 2 Cooperative Nanotech - trying to convert/absorb everyone
 3 His Own Escape Plan - now completely compromised

Key Moments:

 • Silas accessing the vault while the firefight erupts outside
 • The moment he realizes he's been betrayed by someone he trusted
 • Having to choose between saving his stolen fortune or saving his "soul"
 • An unexpected alliance with another rogue element
