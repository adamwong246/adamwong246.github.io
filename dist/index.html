The tragedy of all this is that George McGovern, for all his mistakes and all his imprecise talk about “new politics” and “honesty in government,” is one of the few men who’ve run for President of the United States in this century who really understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon. McGovern made some stupid mistakes, but in context they seem almost frivolous compared to the things Richard Nixon does every day of his life, on purpose, as a matter of policy and a perfect expression of everything he stands for. Jesus! Where will it end? How low do you have to stoop in this country to be President?</p><a href="/blog/63-/index.html" class="right">Read more...</a></article><article><header><h2><a href="/blog/62-/index.html"></a></h2><h4><time>November 20th 2025</time></h4></header><hr><p>I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...
The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance</p><a href="/blog/62-/index.html" class="right">Read more...</a></article><article><header><h2><a href="/blog/61-I-walked-right-out-of-the-machinery-My-life-without-social-media-feeds-and-algorithms/index.html">I walked right out of the machinery- My life without social media, feeds and algorithms</a></h2><h4><time>November 18th 2025</time></h4></header><hr><p>I finally did it. I connected my Android Pixel to my computer and with a little hackery was able to pry the YouTube app off my phone. It comes "preinstalled" on the Pixel, which apparently also means it's "not easily uninstallable". You have to launch the phone in dev mode and use ADB to truly exorcise the demon, but I was not going to let that stop me. And with that, my phone is now without any distractions. Nothing. No Facebook, no Twitter (and no, I will NOT call it X!), no news of any kind. Not even Reddit, one of my oldest and dearest online spaces, escaped my scythe. Not just uninstalled, the accounts have been deleted, and years of careful curation Thanos-snapped away. When I go to the bathroom, I don't even bother to bring my phone anymore. My Pixel is now more like an old Nokia dumb phone, except that you can use it to pay for bus fare.</p><a href="/blog/61-I-walked-right-out-of-the-machinery-My-life-without-social-media-feeds-and-algorithms/index.html" class="right">Read more...</a></article><article><header><h2><a href="/blog/59-Testeranto-01430-testeranto-is-officially-self-testing/index.html">Testeranto 0.143.0 - testeranto is officially self-testing</a></h2><h4><time>July 15th 2025</time></h4></header><hr><p>Sorry for the AI slop but I thought it was well and good to let the LLM describe its own work, since it DID write ~50% of testeranto.
