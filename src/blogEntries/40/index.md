Here a [demo for a Duskers clone](duskers.html) I made over the weekend. It uses a combination of code I ~~borrowed~~ copied from all over the place. I had at first implemented this with React but found inferno.js gave considerable performance benefits. Rot.js provides the procedurally generated levels, while the 2d field-of-view is a modified version of a fork of a typescript version of a implementation based on [this article](https://www.redblobgames.com/articles/visibility/)
